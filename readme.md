# Vertti

Natural Language Processing Neural Network using Linear Regression and the Rectified Linear unit Function to provide a simple yet interactive AI Chatbot

It classifies what the user is talking about and gives the input a tag from a predetermined tags list. The predetermined tag has hand written responses from which it selects one randomly.

All training data is commercial jargon generated with gpt.

The training data is quite poor so the bot is not that smart, as you can see the last 2 entries.
